1. The talk on Semantic Web was well polished - the video format at times was hard to follow but was visually interesting.

2. I enjoyed the talk on TypeScript - I thought it was interesting that Microsoft was able to take the JavaScript language and improve it without changing the core of the language.

3. The talk on D3 was interesting as data visualization is such an relevant topic in the software industry currently.
