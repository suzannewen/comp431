1. I learned way more than I had expected in this class!
2. I loved learning React as well as building both the front and back end and integrating them.
3. Even though it was very difficult, building the entire website from scratch taught me so much about web app development.
4. The pacing of the class was sometimes very difficult to balance with other course work and being out of town for interviews. If I could change just one thing, I would recommend not having in-class assignments due the day of the homeworks.
5. Sometimes I had no idea how to even start the in-class assignment and it usually took over an hour or more to finish.
6. Thank you so much for pouring so much energy into this class! Wow, this is pretty much been my favorite class in Rice and I love how practical it is. I have talked about this class and its project in every single interview I have had, and I feel like I can use the skills picked up from this class in my job next year!
